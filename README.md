CSCI_2270 Final Project

Phase 2 information:  (READ THIS!!)

Project Summary:
Our final project, the three of us have created a program that acts as a police station evidence logger. It is called EvidenceLogger.
Evidence to many cases, both current and past, are stored in police stations across the United States. Evidence is crucial in trials and
to convicting criminals. Most often, police stations have a secure storage room where all of their evidence is housed. Taking evidence in
and out of the room needs to be tracked, so most police stations have a pen and log paper by the door. Sam, Zack, and Matt have not only
eliminated the paper system, but also improved the evidence logging system entirely. We have written a C++ program that acts as a
database for what is in the room and where shelf number, how many of specific evidence items are present, the case number associated with
it, and utilize a user logging feature that keeps track of who specifically has a piece of evidence checked out of the room or if the
evidence is available from the room. 
We have used a Binary Search Tree to organize the evidence and information stored and created an easy to use menu system to navigating
the program and its functions.

How to Run:
Please download, or using Github, “check-out” the code. EvidenceLogger.cpp is our main program and that is the program the user should
access and run within the terminal. Ensure that Evidence.cpp and Evidence.h are stored in the same folder/destination as
EvidenceLogger.cpp. Also ensure that EvidenceLog.txt is in the folder/destination as well. It is instrumental in properly running
EvidenceLogger.cpp with the intended data. 
Compile and run EvidenceLogger.cpp. A familiar menu will appear and the user can explore options by inputting numbers to select specific
menu items. There is a clearly labeled “Quit” option for when the user is finished.

Dependencies:
In order to run or full program/project, the user my first be sure to have 4 files. They are listed:
•	EvidenceLogger.cpp
•	Evidence.cpp
•	Evidence.h
•	EvidenceLog.txt
The text file is instrumental to actually run the program with information inside it. Please ensure all four of these files are acquired
and accessed before attempting to run the program.

System Requirements:
The program was written in a Linux environment. We used C++ and a terminal. Access to a terminal/compiler in a Linux environment will be
sufficient to run our program.
