CSCI_2270 Final Project

Project Idea/Proposal:

For our final project, the three of us have decided to pursue creating a program that acts as a police station evidence logger. Evidence
to many cases, both current and past, are stored in police stations across the United States. Evidence is crucial in trials and to
convicting criminals. Most often, police stations have a secure storage room where all of their evidence is housed. Taking evidence in
and out of the room needs to be tracked, so most police stations have a pen and log paper by the door. Sam, Zack, and Matt propose to not
only eliminate the paper system, but also improve the evidence logging system entirely. We will write a C++ program that acts as a
database for what is in the room and where (possibly by shelf or unit number), how many of the specific evidence items are present, the
case number associated with it, and utilize a user logging feature that keeps track of who specifically has a piece of evidence checked
out of the room.
